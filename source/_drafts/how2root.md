- Once the flash has completed, Don't use the "Fastboot Reboot" Command Instead Unplug Your phone then Manually turn it off by pressing and holding power button until it switches off. Now to enter your newly installed custom recovery, hold volume down + power. The phone should boot into recovery mode. Now that you have a custom recovery, you may continue to the final step.
